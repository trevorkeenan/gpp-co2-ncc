# GPP-CO2
## Overview
This repository contains analysis and plotting scripts to reproduce the emergent constraint results presented in:

Keenan et al. 2023: A constraint on historic growth in global photosynthesis due to increasing CO2.  
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01867-2

Full information on the methods used in this study are attached to this paper and are available
online at the link provided above; this includes information about datasets used, as well as the motivation and reasoning
behind the analysis.


## Folder structure and contents
 ./data/
 
 	dataFile.mat contains the underlying data for the analysis, in particular 
 	the long term GPP products both with and without a CO2 effect 
 	on photosynthetic light-use efficiency. 

./functions contains multiple analysis dependencies.

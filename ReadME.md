# GPP-CO2
## Overview
This repository contains analysis and plotting scripts to reproduce the emergent constraint results presented in:

Keenan et al. 2023: A constraint on historic growth in global photosynthesis due to increasing CO2.

Full information on the methods used in this study are attached to this paper and are available
online at the link provided above; this includes information about datasets used, as well as the motivation and reasoning
behind the analysis.

The scripts, written in Matlab, are:
## A. 
This script derives the relationship between Sland and Beta^{GPP}

## Folder structure and contents
 ./figures/emergent contains the figures produced 
if the save_figures flag is set to 1.

./TRENDYv6_derived contains derived output from the TRENDY model simulations. 
TRENDY model simulations are not publically available but can be obtained through request to Prof. Sitch (S.A.Sitch@exeter.ac.uk)

./functions contains plotting code and the prediction error code.
